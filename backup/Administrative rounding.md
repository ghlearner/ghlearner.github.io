Yesterday the unit director (UD) told me there is an administrative rounding, which means her boss will be following me the morning when I do the bedside handoff report. 

The boss followed us to the outside of the patient's room. I told the oncoming nurse, ”Let’s start with our friend in Room 4X, she is on airborne precaution for r/o TB. We'd better change to N95.”  

While we were putting on the PPE, the boss said, ”Don’t hold the door for me.“ seeing we looked at each other. She explained, ”That’s a joke.” 

When we finished the PPE and looked back on her. She was already gone. No where to find.
