Today I have to write myself up in RiskMaster, an internal platform that anyone can report anything about risk issues, such as medication error, patient bites nurses or doctors. 

I accidentally gave a whole tablet instead of a half of Zoloft, an antidepressants, to a patient. fortunately the patient is a dentist, who is very conscious of what and how much she is taking. She told me she usually takes half tablet. I apologized and cut the pill in halves. 

As I am writing myself in RiskMaster. I feel I need some Zoloft.
