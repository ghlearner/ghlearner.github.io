I drive a Toyota Corolla, the cheapest trim. What do you drive?\r\nPt: Port authority.\r\nPt: Listen, when is your break? I have thirty dollars in my pocket, can you go to GetGo buy me a pack of cigarettes?\r\nMe: Sorry Sir. I usually don't have time leave the hospital on my break. I have other patients.\r\nPt:......\r\nThis is the second time I take care of this patient. CF had a special order for 15 minutes smoke break during last admission. I guess that's the way the doctors try to boost his compliance to treatment. CF has lung cancer that metastasized to the his brain. He got SRS (stereotatic radio surgery) and lost lots of hair, this time he looks like a Mohican. He still drifts in and out of a shelter due to his homelessness. The care team is trying to get contact with his brother and talk about the goal of care. \r\n\r\n\u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1731815221, "style": "", "script": "", "head": "", "ogImage": "https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg", "createdDate": "2024-11-17", "dateLabelColor": "#bc4c00"}}, "singeListJson": {}, "labelColorDict": {"bug": "#d73a4a", "documentation": "#0075ca", "duplicate": "#cfd3d7", "enhancement": "#a2eeef", "good first issue": "#7057ff", "help wanted": "#008672", "invalid": "#e4e669", "question": "#d876e3", "wontfix": "#ffffff"}, "displayTitle": "The POW Project", "faviconUrl": "https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg", "ogImage": "https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg", "primerCSS": "<link href='https://mirrors.sustech.edu.cn/cdnjs/ajax/libs/Primer/21.0.7/primer.css' rel='stylesheet' />", "homeUrl": "https://ghlearner.github.io", "prevUrl": "disabled", "nextUrl": "disabled"}
