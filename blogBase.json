I guess that's the way the doctors try to boost his compliance to treatment. CF has lung cancer that metastasized to the his brain. He got SRS (stereotatic radio surgery) and lost lots of hair, this time he looks like a Mohican. He still drifts in and out of a shelter due to his homelessness. The care team is trying to get contact with his brother and talk about the goal of care. \r\n\r\n\u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1731815221, "style": "", "script": "", "head": "", "ogImage": "https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg", "createdDate": "2024-11-17", "dateLabelColor": "#bc4c00"}, "P2": {"htmlDir": "docs/post/Do you know how I get rich-.html", "labels": ["question"], "postTitle": "Do you know how I get rich?", "postUrl": "post/Do%20you%20know%20how%20I%20get%20rich-.html", "postSourceUrl": "https://github.com/ghlearner/ghlearner.github.io/issues/2", "commentNum": 0, "wordCount": 801, "description": "Nov-11-2024\nNC: Do you know how I become rich?\n\nMe: No. Do share. \n\nNC: I trade crypto.

She is very appreciative of care. \n\nDuring the morning assessment, she told me she wants to get out of the hospital and go to her dental appointment which was scheduled next week. She also longs for her home bed. She was diagnosed last stage breast cancer and went through couple lines of treatments. The doctors advised hospice in goal of care meeting yesterday.\n \nIn the afternoon, as we get to know each other better, she became teary. She held my hand while I was attaching the blood pressure cuff to her arm and asked me, 'Do you think it is cruel to say how much time you left? Why do they do that?' I paused taking her vital signs and tried really hard to get an answer for her. But I didn't. I just said they do that having your best interest in their minds, so that you can arrange things and have good time with your family. \nI asked about her family. She complained about husband's obsession to BBQ, she said she is very proud of her son who is in a neighbor state working a well paid engineering job, she is also glad that her daughter who works for the county. She admitted that all her grand children are doing well at school. \n\nShe thanked me for talking with her. With her hands cupping my hand, she asked me, 'Do you believe in God?' \n\nI replied, 'I am sorry. I am actually not religious. I believe if there is a God, he would be the one to make final decisions and take care of us when we can't.'\n\nI asked her 'Do you want to talk to a pastor? I can page them.'\n\n'No. I don't want to talk with them. I just want to go home.'\u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1731846613, "style": "", "script": "", "head": "", "ogImage": "https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg", "createdDate": "2024-11-17", "dateLabelColor": "#bc4c00"}}, "singeListJson": {}, "labelColorDict": {"bug": "#d73a4a", "documentation": "#0075ca", "duplicate": "#cfd3d7", "enhancement": "#a2eeef", "good first issue": "#7057ff", "help wanted": "#008672", "invalid": "#e4e669", "question": "#d876e3", "wontfix": "#ffffff"}, "displayTitle": "The POW Project", "faviconUrl": "https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg", "ogImage": "https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg", "primerCSS": "<link href='https://mirrors.sustech.edu.cn/cdnjs/ajax/libs/Primer/21.0.7/primer.css' rel='stylesheet' />", "homeUrl": "https://ghlearner.github.io", "prevUrl": "disabled", "nextUrl": "disabled"}
